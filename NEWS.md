## XML-RPC SCHEMAS version xxx - (unreleased)

- imported existing schemas from the phpxmlrpc/extras php package
- fixed a typo in schema.rng and changed its encoding to UTF-8
- fixed links to the xml-rpc spec
- removed `dublin:identifier` from schema.rnc, as that will need to be injected via some CD script
